## Try #1 - Training the Fer2013 Dataset

#### Observations

What makes this different from other image datasets like the *CIFAR-10* is the **lack of differentiation between features of a certain class**. When sorting images into basic classes like *airplanes* or *cars*, there is a more *noticeable* difference then **slight facial clues that tell a human another individual's emotion**.

Many people would say that this problem can be solved relatively easily. However this is not the case.
